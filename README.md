# School Subway Rides
This is the R code that powers my **[in one chart](https://cj-robinson.github.io/portfolio/2024/10/14/student-omny.html)** assignment examining student MTA rides over the past three years. 

It works by pulling CSVs of student rides from the NYC Open Data API and doing some basic cleaning and analysis. I used the final exported data to create my visualization in Datawrapper, which you can find [here](https://cj-robinson.github.io/portfolio/2024/10/14/student-omny.html)!
